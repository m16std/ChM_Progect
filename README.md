# Marquardt's method for finding the minimum of functions of Several Variables

Implemented finding the gradient: ∇f(x), Hessian, direction: -[H+Eλ]∇f(x), 1st and 2nd derivatives of a function of several variables. 
All methods scale for any number of variables by changing the value of only one variable. All comments in Russian so there may be display problems.
